<a id="about"></a>About Me
======
I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/), [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca), under the supervision of [Prof. Ben Liang](https://www.comm.utoronto.ca/~liang). Before that, I received my M.Eng. degree from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en) in 2022, supervised by [Prof. Yuhan Dong](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/dyh_en/), and my B.Eng. degree from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen) in 2019, supervised by [Prof. Xiang Chen](http://www.i3c-sysu.cn/).

My research interests include wireless communications, digital signal processing and physical-layer security.
